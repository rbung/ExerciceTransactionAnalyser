# Analyse transactions test

At Acme Bank, we will have to deal with transactions on a regular basis.
Unfortunately, they are not always formatted and modeled the way we would like.

In this exercise, your only input will be a batch of transactions we could have received last night: _batch.csv_.

In this transactions:

- How many are greater than €20? How much does it represent?
- How many are greater than €50? How much does it represent?

Bonuses:

- Categorize the transactions in 4 categories: restaurant, pub, transport, food
- Deduplicate transaction with its id

There is no technological constraint, it's up to you.
There is no ultimate answer and we are here to build this system together. Let’s code and discuss!
